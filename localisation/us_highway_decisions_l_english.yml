##EVENTS

#Test
ushighway.1.t: "The US Highway System"
ushighway.1.d: "Finally, after 200 years, the automobile industry was restored to its glory. The next step is to give to our citizens a place to ride them. Whether it is to go to work, go on vacation, or tour what is left of America. Also, rebuilding America's highways would be good for our military. Lucky for us, in an old government office in Reno, we found some blueprints for both old and never realized US Highways, we could use them.\n\n The focuses on the first line will let you repair and/or build the US Highways of the related state."
